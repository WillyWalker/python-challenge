Attached are the folders PyBank and PyPoll, as well as an Images Folder.
Inside each Py- Folder, there is each a folder titled "analysis", a file "main.py", and a folder titled "Resources".

The "Resources" folder is a .csv file.

The "main.py" file takes data from the .csv file and outputs results both in the terminal and on a separate .txt file.

The "analysis" contains a blank .txt file, which will be updated with the results of the code when it runs.
